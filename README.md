# Overview

This project investigates hierarchical clustering on the Wine dataset. It compares AGNES (agglomerative) and DIANA (divisive) approaches using several linkage methods, evaluates cohesion metrics (agglomerative/divisive coefficients), inspects dendrograms, and recommends the most appropriate hierarchical method for this dataset. The report contains code, plots, and interpretation. 

# Finding

- AGNES with Ward’s method produced the most cohesive clusters and gave the clearest dendrogram separation — recommended for this dataset.

- AGNES produced 3 well-separated clusters in this analysis; DIANA showed structure but with weaker separation.
